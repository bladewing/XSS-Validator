# XSS Validator - Development Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to develop an application that checks whether students have found a way to insert an XSS script into a website.

## Project Setup

- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up virtual environment using uv
- [x] Create initial pyproject.toml with required dependencies
- [x] Set up linting and formatting tools (Black, Flake8)
- [x] Configure Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

## Core Functionality

- [x] Research and select appropriate browser automation library (Selenium/Playwright)
- [x] Implement browser initialization in headless mode
- [x] Create utility functions for browser management
- [x] Implement popup detection mechanism
- [x] Create timeout handling for 5-second detection window
- [x] Implement cleanup procedures for browser instances

## Input Handling

- [x] Implement URL parameter parsing functionality
- [x] Create function to extract and process search input values
- [x] Implement input sanitization and validation
- [x] Create unified input processing pipeline

## API Development

- [x] Design API endpoints for both input methods
- [x] Implement API endpoint for search input validation
  - [x] Accept input query
  - [x] Process input through browser automation
  - [x] Return boolean result based on popup detection
- [x] Implement API endpoint for URL validation
  - [x] Accept URI parameter
  - [x] Process URL through browser automation
  - [x] Return boolean result based on popup detection
- [x] Create error handling for API endpoints
- [x] Implement logging for API requests and responses

## Testing

- [x] Create unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Develop integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Create test fixtures with known XSS payloads
- [x] Implement tests for edge cases (timeouts, malformed inputs)
- [ ] Create performance tests for concurrent API usage

## Dockerization

- [x] Create Dockerfile for the application
- [x] Configure Docker to support headless browser operation
- [x] Implement Docker Compose for local development
- [x] Optimize Docker image size and build time
- [ ] Create documentation for Docker usage

## Documentation

- [x] Write API documentation with examples
- [x] Create usage examples for both input methods
- [ ] Document known limitations and edge cases
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Write deployment instructions

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Perform security review of the application
- [x] Conduct code review for best practices
- [x] Ensure all tests pass consistently
- [ ] Verify Docker container works in various environments
- [ ] Check for any performance bottlenecks
