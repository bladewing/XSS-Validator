# XSS Validator - Development Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to develop an application that checks whether students have found a way to insert an XSS script into a website.

## Project Setup

- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up virtual environment using uv
- [x] Create initial pyproject.toml with required dependencies
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting tools (Black, Flake8)
- [x] Configure Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

## Core Functionality

- [ ] Research and select appropriate browser automation library (Selenium/Playwright)
- [ ] Implement browser initialization in headless mode
- [ ] Create utility functions for browser management
- [ ] Implement popup detection mechanism
- [ ] Create timeout handling for 5-second detection window
- [ ] Implement cleanup procedures for browser instances

## Input Handling

- [ ] Implement URL parameter parsing functionality
- [ ] Create function to extract and process search input values
- [ ] Implement input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Create unified input processing pipeline

## API Development

- [ ] Design API endpoints for both input methods
- [ ] Implement API endpoint for search input validation
  - [ ] Accept input query
  - [ ] Process input through browser automation
  - [ ] Return boolean result based on popup detection
- [ ] Implement API endpoint for URL validation
  - [ ] Accept URI parameter
  - [ ] Process URL through browser automation
  - [ ] Return boolean result based on popup detection
- [ ] Create error handling for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement logging for API requests and responses

## Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Develop integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create test fixtures with known XSS payloads
- [ ] Implement tests for edge cases (timeouts, malformed inputs)
- [ ] Create performance tests for concurrent API usage

## Dockerization

- [ ] Create Dockerfile for the application
- [ ] Configure Docker to support headless browser operation
- [ ] Implement Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Optimize Docker image size and build time
- [ ] Create documentation for Docker usage

## Documentation

- [ ] Write API documentation with examples
- [ ] Create usage examples for both input methods
- [ ] Document known limitations and edge cases
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Write deployment instructions

## Quality Assurance

- [ ] Perform security review of the application
- [ ] Conduct code review for best practices
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass consistently
- [ ] Verify Docker container works in various environments
- [ ] Check for any performance bottlenecks
